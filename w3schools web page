<h1>try baking for a hobby
<p>baking is a fun hobby.</p>baking is a fun and crazy experence you can make anything that you could possibly think of. my favorite part about baking is making sweet and savery deserts. their ar many different ways to bake things you can bake from completly scratch, or you can do partly scratch and half pre made, or you can do it all premade. one of my favioret things i have ever made was apple pie. although baking can sometimes be stressful it is still a really fun hobbie people should learn
<body>apple pie
4 large firm tart apples
▢1/3 cup sugar
▢1/3 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
▢3 tablespoons cornstarch
▢1/4 teaspoon salt
▢1 teaspoon cinnamon
▢1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
▢1 (14.1-ounce) box premade refrigerated pie crusts (2 count)
▢2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small cubes
 Preheat the oven to 450°F. Peel, core, and slice the apples into 1/8-inch slices.
▢
Add the apples to a large bowl. In a small bowl, whisk the sugar, brown sugar, cornstarch, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together. Sprinkle over the apples and toss to coat the apples in the sugar mixture.
▢
Allow the pie crusts to come to room temperature then gently unroll one crust to cover the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie dish. Trim off the excess crust around the edges.
▢
Add the apples and any juice from the bowl into the crust. Spread the apples out evenly in the crust. Sprinkle the butter over the apples.
▢
Gently unroll the other crust and place it centered over the pie dish. Fold any overhang under the edge of the bottom crust and pinch together to seal. Crimp to form a decorative edge. Cut 3 to 4 3-inch slits in the top of the pie to allow it to vent.
▢
Place the pie on a rimmed baking sheet and place in the oven. Bake for 10 minutes at 450°F then reduce the heat to 350°F and bake for an additional 50 minutes. If the edges brown too quickly, cover them with strips of aluminum foil.
▢
Allow the pie to cool completely, 2 to 3 hours, before slicing. The filling will thicken as it cools. Serve slightly warmed with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, if desired.
<html>8 tablespoons of salted butter
1/2 cup white sugar (I like to use raw cane sugar with a coarser texture)
1/4 cup packed light brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 egg
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour (6.75 ounces)
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt (but I always add a little extra)
3/4 cup chocolate chips (I use a combination of chocolate chips and chocolate chunks)Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Microwave the butter for about 40 seconds to just barely melt it. It shouldn’t be hot – but it should be almost entirely in liquid form.Using a stand mixer or electric beaters, beat the butter with the sugars until creamy. Add the vanilla and the egg; beat on low speed until just incorporated – 10-15 seconds or so (if you beat the egg for too long, the cookies will be stiff).�Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix until crumbles form. Use your hands to press the crumbles together into a dough. It should form one large ball that is easy to handle (right at the stage between “wet” dough and “dry” dough). Add the chocolate chips and incorporate with your hands.�Roll the dough into 12 large balls (or 9 for HUGELY awesome cookies) and place on a cookie sheet. Bake for 9-11 minutes until the cookies look puffy and dry and just barely golden. Warning, friends: DO NOT OVERBAKE. This advice is probably written on every cookie recipe everywhere, but this is essential for keeping the cookies soft. Take them out even if they look like they’re not done yet (see picture in the post). They’ll be pale and puffy.Let them cool on the pan for a good 30 minutes or so (I mean, okay, eat four or five but then let the rest of them cool). They will sink down and turn into these dense, buttery, soft cookies that are the best in all the land. These should stay soft for many days if kept in an airtight container.�
